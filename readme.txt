The WordPress Hubspot Connector integrates WordPress content and tracking directly into the HubSpot Social Publishing pipeline. 

== Description ==
Offers two main functions:<br>
a) Pushes your wordpress posts and RSS feed to HubSpot. <br>
b) Implements HubSpot Tracking Code in your wordpress Site.<br>

If your content is in WordPress or is available in an RSS Field, you can automatically push that directly into the HubSpot Social Publishing pipeline. This saves time and helps integrate and track your content across platforms into Hubspot's Analytics.
